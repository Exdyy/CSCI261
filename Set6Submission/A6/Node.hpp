 * Resources used (Office Hours, Tutoring, Other Students, etc & in what capacity):
 *     // list here any outside assistance you used/received while following the
 *     // CS@Mines Collaboration Policy and the Mines Academic Code of Honor
 *     // Lecture slides, stackOverflow for fixing errors, attempted to learn from youtube videos to no avail
 * This program is supposed to read in a .maze file, and use either BFS or DFS search methods with queues/stacks, but I cannot get it to work properly and I need some amount of points, so here is my attempt.
